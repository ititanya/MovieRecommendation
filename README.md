# MovieRecommendation
This project is a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System built using Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit.
It recommends movies similar to the selected movie by analyzing movie descriptions, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
The ML model is trained using TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity, and the final model is saved using Pickle for fast loading.
